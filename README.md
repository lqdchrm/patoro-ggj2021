# About **üê∂Find Losty**
[Find Losty](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/find-losty-5) is an old-school-like text adventure
for multiple players, which can be played via Discord.

The idea was born at the [2021 Global Game Jam in Trier](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/jam-sites/trier),
where we participated as a group of three developers.

A video of the presentation can be watched here (in German): [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/895590427?t=01h10m07s)

## üìñStory
Your dog **[üê∂Losty]** ran away and somehow entered the scary abandoned **[üè°mansion]** down the road.
You gather a few friends and start a rescue mission.

The game starts directly in front of the **[üè°mansion]**.

## üéÆControls
The game is controlled by a virtual GameMaster aka **[ü§ñBot]** (this is some kind of AI if you will).
This **[ü§ñBot]** gives you a textual representation of the things happening in-game.

Each location in the game happens inside a specific Discord-*VoiceChannel*, which you join.
This way you can only talk to and hear the persons staying with you at the same location.

To take action, each player gets a dedicated Discord-*TextChannel*. You can act in the game by typing
in commands like eg. `open door`. For each command you get textual feedback, which can contain
**[üßªnew things to interact with]**, **[üè†new rooms to explore]** and **[‚ùìchallenging riddles to solve]**.
Some riddles require cooperation with other players.

For a start try to type `help` inside your personal *Text-Channel*, which lists all available commands,
or type `look` to get information about your surroundings. You can change rooms either by changing you
Discord-*VoiceChannel* or by typing the `goto`-command eg. `goto kitchen`.

## üö¶How to start
In order to use the Game with Discord, you have to invite the **[ü§ñBot]** to your Server
(see [üîßPreparation](#üîßPreparation)). You start the executable and a new section **`FindLosty`**
should appear on the left side in Discord.

Inside this section there are the various *VoiceChannels*, one per room you discovered. `FrontYard`
is the game's starting location. Players can join this *Voice-Channel* to join the game.

After joining, each player gets a personal *TextChannel* where the adventure takes place.

## üîßPreparation

### ‚ú®Getting a token for the bot
The game aka **[ü§ñBot]** needs to identify to Discord via a **[‚ú® token]** at startup. Therefore
you need to get a **[‚ú®token]** for your **[ü§ñBot]** from Discord.

The process of obtaining a **[‚ú®token]** works roughly as follows:
* create a new app at the [Discord developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
this gives you a *client-id* 
* create a new **[ü§ñBot]** inside this app, which gives you the **[‚ú® token]**

Then you need to create a new file called `.env` or you could rename the existing file `.env.sample` to `.env`.

Inside this file you enter your **[ü§ñBot]**'s **[‚ú® token]**:

> DISCORD_TOKEN=XXXXXxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

This `.env` file must be put inside the same folder as your executable, or - if you build from source - at the root of the project.

### ü§ñInviting the bot to your Discord-Server
To invite the **[ü§ñBot]**, you need to authorize it at your server via a **[üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èlink]**.
When you start the executable the **[üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èlink]** for authorization will be shown in the **[üíªterminal]**, eg.

~~~ bash
[ENGINE] Creating Discord client ...
[ENGINE] ... Discord client created
[ENGINE] Adding Handlers ...
[ENGINE] ... Handlers added 
[ENGINE] Connecting ...
[2021-02-07 21:50:57 +01:00] [101 /Startup     ] [Info ] DSharpPlus, version 4.0.0-rc1
[ENGINE] ... Connected
Use following URL to invite the bot to your Server:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=$CLIENTID&permissions=297802768&scope=bot
[ENGINE] ... Guild added $YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER
~~~

Just open this **[üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èlink]** and Discord will ask you which server you want the **[ü§ñBot]** been invited to.

## Building from source
**üê∂Find Losty** is programmed in `C#` with [DotNet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).

The usual commands `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet run` and `dotnet publish` apply.

For debugging purpose the Game-Engine contains a local mode, which can be started by:

> dotnet run -- interactive

Warning: You need to run this in a unicode/utf-8 enabled **[üíªterminal]**.

Now you can go crazy, eg. by piping **[üìúscript files]** with commands to the locally running process. See `./test.sh` for an example.
