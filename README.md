# About **🐶Find Losty**
[Find Losty](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/find-losty-5) is an old-school-like text adventure
for multiple players, which can be played via Discord.

The idea was born at the [2021 Global Game Jam in Trier](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/jam-sites/trier),
where we participated as a group of three developers.

A video of the presentation can be watched here (in German): [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/895590427?t=01h10m07s)

## 📖Story
Your dog **[🐶Losty]** ran away and somehow entered the scary abandoned **[🏡mansion]** down the road.
You gather a few friends and start a rescue mission.

The game starts directly in front of the **[🏡mansion]**.

## 🎮Controls
The game is controlled by a virtual GameMaster aka **[🤖Bot]** (this is some kind of AI if you will).
This **[🤖Bot]** gives you a textual representation of the things happening in-game.

Each location in the game happens inside a specific Discord-*VoiceChannel*, which you join.
This way you can only talk to and hear the persons staying with you at the same location.

To take action, each player gets a dedicated Discord-*TextChannel*. You can act in the game by typing
in commands like eg. `open door`. For each command you get textual feedback, which can contain
**[🧻new things to interact with]**, **[🏠new rooms to explore]** and **[❓challenging riddles to solve]**.
Some riddles require cooperation with other players.

For a start try to type `help` inside your personal *Text-Channel*, which lists all available commands,
or type `look` to get information about your surroundings. You can change rooms either by changing you
Discord-*VoiceChannel* or by typing the `goto`-command eg. `goto kitchen`.

## 🚦How to start
In order to use the Game with Discord, you have to invite the **[🤖Bot]** to your Server
(see [🔧Preparation](#🔧Preparation)). You start the executable and a new section **`FindLosty`**
should appear on the left side in Discord.

Inside this section there are the various *VoiceChannels*, one per room you discovered. `FrontYard`
is the game's starting location. Players can join this *Voice-Channel* to join the game.

After joining, each player gets a personal *TextChannel* where the adventure takes place.

## 🔧Preparation

### ✨Getting a token for the bot
The game aka **[🤖Bot]** needs to identify to Discord via a **[✨ token]** at startup. Therefore
you need to get a **[✨token]** for your **[🤖Bot]** from Discord.

The process of obtaining a **[✨token]** works roughly as follows:
* create a new app at the [Discord developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
this gives you a *client-id* 
* create a new **[🤖Bot]** inside this app, which gives you the **[✨ token]**

Then you need to create a new file called `.env` or you could rename the existing file `.env.sample` to `.env`.

Inside this file you enter your **[🤖Bot]**'s **[✨ token]**:

> DISCORD_TOKEN=XXXXXxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

This `.env` file must be put inside the same folder as your executable, or - if you build from source - at the root of the project.

### 🤖Inviting the bot to your Discord-Server
To invite the **[🤖Bot]**, you need to authorize it at your server via a **[🧝‍♂️link]**.
When you start the executable the **[🧝‍♂️link]** for authorization will be shown in the **[💻terminal]**, eg.

~~~ bash
[ENGINE] Creating Discord client ...
[ENGINE] ... Discord client created
[ENGINE] Adding Handlers ...
[ENGINE] ... Handlers added 
[ENGINE] Connecting ...
[2021-02-07 21:50:57 +01:00] [101 /Startup     ] [Info ] DSharpPlus, version 4.0.0-rc1
[ENGINE] ... Connected
Use following URL to invite the bot to your Server:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=$CLIENTID&permissions=297802768&scope=bot
[ENGINE] ... Guild added $YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER
~~~

Just open this **[🧝‍♂️link]** and Discord will ask you which server you want the **[🤖Bot]** been invited to.

## Building from source
**🐶Find Losty** is programmed in `C#` with [DotNet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).

The usual commands `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet run` and `dotnet publish` apply.

For debugging purpose the Game-Engine contains a local mode, which can be started by:

> dotnet run -- interactive

Warning: You need to run this in a unicode/utf-8 enabled **[💻terminal]**.

Now you can go crazy, eg. by piping **[📜script files]** with commands to the locally running process. See `./test.sh` for an example.
