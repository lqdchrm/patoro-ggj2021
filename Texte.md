   You're looking at the beautiful front yard of 404 Foundleroy Road.
   A picket fence surrounds the mansion in front of you.
   There seems to be only one way into the building. A large oak [door].
   This looks like some kind of maniac lives here.
   
   You here barking.
   
   Your friends <insert friends> are here.

   Knock door (closed)
   -------------------

   ------------------
   As the old saying goes: 'This will hurt you a lot more than it will the [door].'
